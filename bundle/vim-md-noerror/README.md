Vim markdown highlighting
=========================

This is a copy of [vim-markdown](https://github.com/tpope/vim-markdown), but
without the syntax error highlighting. I find this highlighting very annoying
because it highlights single underscores, which I often use in documenting
functions_with_underscores.
