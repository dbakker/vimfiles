textobj-comment
---------------

This Vim plugin provides text objects to select comments.

"ac" selects a comment including the comment delimiters, "ic" selects the
comment content without the delimiters. A third text object, "aC", selects a
"big" comment, including trailing or leading whitespace.

textobj-comment uses the filetype-specific 'comments' setting to determine
what a comment looks like for a given language. Make sure you have enabled
filetype plugins in your configuration to make this work.

In order to find a target, textobj-comment looks for a comment under the
cursor, in or at the end of the cursor line, and above the cursor line. You
can see a demo of the text objects and the heuristic in the documentation.

This plugin depends on the textobj-user plugin, version 0.4.0.

Installation
------------

Move the files into their respective directories inside your ~/.vim directory
(or your $HOME\vimfiles directory if you're on Windows).

With the Pathogen plugin manager the installation is as simple as:

cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone git://github.com/glts/vim-textobj-comment.git textobj-comment

But this plugin also plays well with the built-in GetLatestVimScripts and
other plugin managers such as Vundle, vim-addon-manager, and vim-flavor.

Development
-----------

If you are interested in working on the code, use the test suite to make sure
you don't break anything.

The test suite is written using vspec, version 1.1.0.
https://github.com/kana/vim-vspec

Use "make test" to run the whole suite, and "make t/<test>.vim" to run a
specific test. You may need to adapt the paths to the vspec executable and to
the runtime path directories at the top of the Makefile.
